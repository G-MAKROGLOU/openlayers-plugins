# openlayers-plugins
Openlayers plugins for GIS applications.

Custom plugins for the Openlayers GIS library exported in either vanilla JavaScript (ES6) or as React Components with JavaScript (ES6).
Pulling the repository will download both for now but they will later be split in two different repositories each of them with instructions
on how to use the plugins.
